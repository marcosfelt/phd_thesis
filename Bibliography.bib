The inability of explaining why a neural network makes a prediction is a major barrier to deployment of AI models. This not only dissuades chemists from using deep learning predictions, but also has led to neural networks learning spurious correlations that are difficult to notice. Counterfactuals are a category of explanations that provide a rationale behind a model prediction with satisfying properties like providing chemical structure insights. Yet, counterfactuals have been previously limited to specific model architectures or required reinforcement learning as a separate process. In this work, we show a universal model-agnostic approach that can explain any black-box model prediction. We demonstrate this method on random forest models, sequence models, and graph neural networks in both classification and regression.}

The inability of explaining why a neural network makes a prediction is a major barrier to deployment of AI models. This not only dissuades chemists from using deep learning predictions, but also has led to neural networks learning spurious correlations that are difficult to notice. Counterfactuals are a category of explanations that provide a rationale behind a model prediction with satisfying properties like providing chemical structure insights. Yet, counterfactuals have been previously limited to specific model architectures or required reinforcement learning as a separate process. In this work, we show a universal model-agnostic approach that can explain any black-box model prediction. We demonstrate this method on random forest models, sequence models, and graph neural networks in both classification and regression.}

	abstract     = {Message passing neural networks have become a method of choice for learning on graphs, in particular the prediction of chemical properties and the acceleration of molecular dynamics studies. While they readily scale to large training data sets, previous approaches have proven to be less data efficient than kernel methods. We identify limitations of invariant representations as a major reason and extend the message passing formulation to rotationally equivariant representations. On this basis, we propose the polarizable atom interaction neural network (PaiNN) and improve on common molecule benchmarks over previous networks, while reducing model size and inference time. We leverage the equivariant atomwise representations obtained by PaiNN for the prediction of tensorial properties. Finally, we apply this to the simulation of molecular spectra, achieving speedups of 4-5 orders of magnitude compared to the electronic structure reference.}

	abstract     = {Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.}

Due to the simple concept, easy implementation and quick convergence, nowadays DE has gained much attention and wide application in solving continuous non-linear optimization problems. However, the performance of DE greatly depends on its control parameters and it often suffers from being trapped in local optimum. The application of chaotic sequences based on chaotic Zaslavskii map instead of random sequences in DE is a powerful strategy to diversify the population and improve the DE's performance in preventing premature convergence to local optima. The optimized PD and PID controllers shows good closed-loop responses in control of the binary Wood-Berry distillation column, a multivariable process with strong interactions between input and output pairs. Some comparison results of PD and PID tuning using chaotic DE, classical DE and genetic algorithm are presented and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

This was motivated by the observation that the initial open-loop response of lag-dominant processes, such as tray temperature in high-purity distillation columns, resembles that of a delayed ramp variable. This study compares the behaviour of several PID $\lambda$-tuning rules with the Skogestad internal model control (or SIMC) proportional-integral (PI) controller on simulated integrator-plus-deadtime and lag-dominant first-order plants. Guidelines are provided for selecting the most appropriate tuning method for a given application based on the primary function of the feedback loop (servo against regulatory) as well as the relative importance of control effort and robustness. In contrast, the PID version of the Tyreus-Luyben controller, a popular strategy for this class of models, was found to yield excellent setpoint following but sluggish rejection of unmeasured disturbances acting at the plant input. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

Experimental steady-state and dynamic plant data were used to obtain steady-state and dynamic models. Then computer simulation studies were performed for a number of conventional and nonconventional control structures. The two best configurations were (1) the reflux ratio-boilup ratio (RR-BR) scheme suggested by Shinskey and (2) an unorthodox distillate-bottoms (D-B) scheme. The latter uses fewer sensors and is less complex, but it is more fragile. If any sensor fails or any valve saturates, the D-B scheme will not work. The D-B scheme was installed on the Sun Oil commercial C3Splitter in November 1987, using a Honeywell TDC 2000 system. Its ability to provide effective control has been demonstrated. Override controls have been used to reduce the fragility of the D-B structure to valve saturation. {\textcopyright} 1989, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

In particular, the first issue about which variables to control has received little attention. It is argued that the answer is related to finding a simple and robust way of implementing the economically optimal operating policy. The goal is to find a set of controlled variables which, when kept at constant setpoints, indirectly lead to near-optimal operation with acceptable loss. This is denoted `self-optimizing' control. Since the economics are determined by the overall plant behavior, it is necessary to take a plantwide perspective. A systematic procedure for finding suitable controlled variables based on only steady-state information is presented. Important steps are degree of freedom analysis, definition of optimal operation (cost and constraints), and evaluation of the loss when the controlled variables are kept constant rather than optimally adjusted. A case study yields very interesting insights into the control and maximum throughput of distillation columns.},

The control relevant characteristics such as nonlinearities, interactions, and stability are analyzed for assessing the complexity of the process. The objective of GA tuning is to account the multivariable interactions and nonlinear dynamics of the process to find a unique set of parameters for the control system that is robust to all kinds of disturbances. The performance function in GA is formulated by incorporating the dynamic state information of the process derived from its model for various closed-loop disturbance conditions. The controller tuning problem of this multivariable process is resolved as an optimization problem and multiloop PI controllers are designed by exploiting the powerful global search features of GA. An estimator is designed to provide the compositions which serve as inferential measurements to the controllers. The performance of the proposed GA-tuned decentralized control scheme is evaluated by applying it to a metathesis reactive distillation column, and the results are compared with conventionally tuned PI controllers. The results demonstrate the better regulatory and servo performance of the GA-tuned PI controllers for composition control of reactive distillation column. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

A number of criteria have been proposed for selecting which trays to hold at constant temperature. The most commonly used are (1) choosing a tray where there are large changes in temperature from tray to tray ("slope" of the temperature profile), (2) finding the tray where there is the largest change in temperature for a change in the manipulated variable ("sensitivity"), (3) using singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, (4) selecting the tray where the temperature does not change as feed composition changes while producing the desired distillate and bottoms purities and (5) choosing the tray that produces the smallest changes in product purities when it is held constant in the face of feed composition disturbances. This paper provides a quantitative comparison of the effectiveness of these five alternative criteria. Several systems are considered, ranging from ideal binary to azeotropic multi-component.

This method proposes the input-output pairing problem as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). For each control structure and loop pairing analyzed, a different design concept is proposed and a MOP is stated. All MOPs share the same design objectives, and Pareto fronts associated with each design concept can be compared globally under a multi-objective (MO) approach. The design objectives were chosen for the MOP, as well as the designer's preferences, have an important role in selecting a certain loop pairing. The main contribution of the proposed approach is that it enables a systematic analysis of the conflicts between the objectives and the performance of a control system. The method enables selecting a certain input-output pairing and a suitable tuning of the controller directly using information that a designer can interpret. To show the application of the methodology, two loop pairing examples are presented, one of them for a two-input-output system (with four scenarios of analysis), and the other for a three-input-output system (with one scenario of analysis). Through the examples presented in this paper, it is evident how the designer can affect the loop pairing to be used, either by choosing the objectives or preferences.},

The proposed multivariable automatic tuning performs the identification‐design procedure in a sequential manner. Its advantages are discussed, as well as the process characteristics resulted from sequential design. One important feature is that the sequential design often leads to underdamped process characteristics. Given these characteristics, potential problems in the Ziegler‐Nichols tuning are discussed and a modification is made. The sequential identification and the modified Ziegler‐Nichols controller design method form the basic structure for the multivariable autotuner. The properties of convergence, the implications of tuning sequence, and the indications of undesirable pairing for the autotuner are explored. Consequently, a multivariable autotuning procedure is proposed. Two nonlinear distillation examples and a 3 × 3 linear system are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the autotuner. Simulation results show that good performance can be obtained with minimal engineering effort and the autotuner works well for very difficult processes in a very simple way.

Feedback control is crucial for achieving the stringent regulatory requirements on CQAs of pharmaceutical products in the presence of process uncertainties and disturbances. To this end, a key challenge arises from complex plant-wide dynamics of the integrated process units in a continuous pharmaceutical process, that is, dynamical interactions between several process units. This paper presents two plant-wide MPC designs for the end-to-end continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing pilot plant using the quadratic dynamic matrix control algorithm. The plant-wide MPC designs are based on different modeling approaches - subspace identification and linearization of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations that yield, respectively, linear low-dimensional and high-dimensional state-space models for the plant-wide dynamics. The closed-loop performance of the plant-wide MPC designs is evaluated using a nonlinear plant simulator equipped with a stabilizing control layer. The closed-loop simulation results demonstrate that the plant-wide MPC systems can facilitate effective regulation of CQAs and flexible process operation in the presence of uncertainties in reaction kinetics, persistent drifts in efficiency of filtration units, temporary disturbances in purity of intermediate compounds, and set point changes. The plant-wide MPC allows for incorporating quality-by-design considerations into the control problem through input and output constraints to ensure regulatory compliant process operation.},

In the first strategy, which we term 'J-learning,' one builds an empirical nonlinear model using closed-loop test data and performs dynamic programming with it to derive an improved control policy. In the second strategy, called 'Q-learning,' one tries to learn an improved control policy in a model-less manner. Compared to the conventional model predictive control approach, the new approach offers some practical advantages in using nonlinear empirical models for process control. Besides the potential reduction in the on-line computational burden, it offers a convenient way to control the degree of model extrapolation in the calculation of optimal control moves. One major difficulty associated with using an empirical model within the multi-step predictive control setting is that the model can be excessively extrapolated into regions of the state space where identification data were scarce or nonexistent, leading to performances far worse than predicted by the model. Within the proposed ADP-based strategies, this problem is handled by imposing a penalty term designed on the basis of local data distribution. A CSTR example is provided to illustrate the proposed approaches.},

Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies “end-to-end”: directly from raw pixel inputs.},

The current methods for solvent exchange, batch distillation and diafiltration, also produce a waste stream containing a mixture of the feed and chasing solvents that must be separated, usually by distillation. The results obtained from an Aspen Plus model of the new exchange column are compared with constant volume batch distillation simulations for both still pot and still pot plus column systems. The new solvent exchange column reduces the amount of the waste stream, and when the feed solvent is the more volatile solvent the exchange column can often be designed to produce feed solvent at the desired purity; thus, eliminating the need for an additional distillation column to separate the two solvents. When the initial solvent is the less volatile component, the new exchange column will often be competitive with constant volume diafiltration which is currently used.},

There is no single "best" structure for all columns, so some authors feel that each column should be treated independently. Nevertheless , the objective of this work is to find for a structure that is "reasonable" for all columns. In this paper, we consider the steady-state deviations in product composition , assuming that we only have available flows and temperatures for control. By using local methods, including the exact local method and the minimum singular value rule, we search for two "self-optimizing" variables, which when held constant result in small deviations in the presence of disturbances. We find that for most columns, a good choice is to keep a constant reflux to feed ratio L/F and keep a constant temperature in the middle of the bottom section of the column. Especially for multicomponent separations, it does not help to control two temperatures.},

Unlike other works, where only the Pareto optimal solutions are considered, we also consider the set of nearly optimal solutions nondominated in their neighborhood. These solutions are potentially useful for two reasons: 1) they are similar to the optimal solutions for the optimized objectives, and; 2) they differ significantly in their parameters. This last point makes them interesting, since they bring diversity and different characteristics to the set of solutions for analyzing in the decision stage. In problems of controller parameter adjustment, especially for multivariable processes, there are many conflicting objectives. To simplify the optimization problem and decision stage, it is common to aggregate some of the objectives, and so simplify the initial problem. In this scenario, some controllers that were optimal for the initial problem can become nearly optimal in the simplified case. When these controllers are nondominated in their neighborhood, they are especially interesting because they usually present a different trade-off for the initial objectives. For the calculation of nearly optimal solutions nondominated in their neighborhood, the evolutionary algorithm nevMOGA was used. In this paper, the usefulness of considering these solutions is revealed in two controller design problems: The Wood Berry distillation column and the CIC2018 control benchmark.},

The response to changes in the external flows is approximately first order with time constant $\tau$1 This dominant time constant can be estimated by using a simple mixing tank model for the column. The response to changes in the internal flows is also first order, but its time constant $\tau$2 is generally significantly smaller than $\tau$1 The condition number and the RGA are smaller at high frequency than at steady state. Most models presented in the literature do not take this into account. The two time constant model does predict this behavior, and $\tau$2can be estimated by matching the RGA at high frequency. Finally, it is shown that the effect of nonlinearity is almost eliminated if logarithmic compositions In xB and In (1 - yD) are used. In particular, this applies to the initial response which is of primary importance for feedback control. {\textcopyright} 1988, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

The salient feature of the method is that it reduces the multi-loop PID tuning parameters from 4n to only 4 common multi-scale control parameters. Both heuristic- and optimization-based procedures are proposed in order to apply the simultaneous tuning method, which should substantially simplify difficult multi-loop tuning involving numerous controller parameters. To ensure adequate robustness of the multi-loop control system, the balanced sensitivity function is used with the tuning method.

The column separates ethanol and water and the set-up is used to implement different advanced control and operational techniques. An ideal supervisory scheme was proposed and accordingly gross error detection, identification and estimation, data reconciliation, simulation, efficiency modification and optimisation modules were implemented to provide the grounds for advanced operation of chemical processes. It is shown that these techniques play a vital role in control and optimisation of a given process. Furthermore, a novel robust multivariable, low order, high performance, model-based controller was designed and implemented as a standard PID block within the DCS. Finally, the answer to an important question of how close to the optimum can an operator operate without fear of violating the constraints in the face of disturbances is discussed; this led to a semi-online optimising control program acting as another informative module that completes a unified framework. The paper is accompanied by some experimental evidence which demonstrate the importance of each implemented module individually and as a unified set-up. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, the numbering-up is presented for multi-phase (gas-liquid) flow in microreactor suitable for a production capacity of kg/h. Based on the barrier channels concept, the barrier-based micro/milli reactor (BMMR) is designed and fabricated to deliver flow non-uniformity of less than 10{\%}. The BMMR consists of eight parallel channels all operated in the Taylor flow regime and with a liquid flow rate up to 150. mL/min. The quality of the flow distribution is reported by studying two aspects. The first aspect is the influence of different viscosities, surface tensions and flow rates. The second aspect is the influence of modularity by testing three different reaction channels type: (1) square channels fabricated in a stainless steel plate, (2) square channels fabricated in a glass plate, and (3) circular channels (capillaries) made of stainless steel. Additionally, the BMMR is compared to that of a single channel regard the slug and bubble lengths and bubble generation frequency. The results pave the ground for bringing multi-phase flow in microreactor one step closer for large scale production via numbering-up. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, one of the limitations of photocatalysis and photochemistry in general is the limited scalability due to the absorption of light (Lambert-Beer law). Here, we report the development of a convenient numbering-up strategy for the scale-up of gas-liquid photocatalytic reactions in which the gas is consumed. Only commercially available constituents were used and the system can be rapidly assembled by any practitioner of flow chemistry. The modular design allows us to systematically scale the photochemistry within 2n parallel reactors (herein, n = 0, 1, 2, 3). The flow distribution in the absence of reactions was excellent, showing a standard deviation less than 5{\%}. Next, we used the numbered-up photomicroreactor assembly to enable the scale-up of the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of thiols to disulfides. The flow distribution was again very good with a standard deviation lower than 10{\%}. The yield of the target disulfide in the numbered-up assemblies was comparable to the results obtained in a single device demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

	abstract     = {A general distillation model permitting the use of hybrid models for simulation of distillation column operations is presented. Hybrid models, by definition, include more than one distillation model and/or simulation mode during the simulation of a specified distillation operation. The hybrid models are generated through a combination of the rate-based and/or equilibrium-based models of different complexities and solved through a hybrid solution approach where the hybrid model equations are solved in steady state and/or dynamic simulation modes. Starting from the general distillation model, for a specified distillation operation, the necessary problem specific model(s) is generated through elimination of terms that may have negligible affects on the simulation results. The general distillation model from which all other models are generated, is a rate-based model. The simplest distillation model that can be generated is a steady state equimolar overflow model. The paper describes the general distillation model equations, the generation of hybrid models and the corresponding hybrid solution approach. In particular, the paper highlights the use of the hybrid solution approach for initialization with respect to a specified simulation problem, for design/analysis of distillation operations and for monitoring of phenomena such as the path to an equilibrium state. Results from three well-known distillation systems, with and without reactions, are presented. These test problems have been used to validate the hybrid features of the general distillation model and to highlight the use of the hybrid modelling approach for simulation, design and analysis of different distillation operations.},

In the last two decades, these two metrics have been adopted worldwide by both academia and industry. The E factor has been refined to distinguish between simple and complete E factors, for example, and to define the system boundaries. Other mass-based metrics such as process mass intensity (PMI) and reaction mass efficiency (RME) have been proposed. However, mass-based metrics need to be augmented by metrics which measure the environmental impact of waste, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), and metrics for assessing the economic viability of products and processes. The application of such metrics in measuring the sustainability of processes for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals is discussed in detail. Mass-based metrics alone are not sufficient to measure the greenness and sustainability of processes for the conversion of renewable biomass vs fossil-based feedstocks. Various metrics for use in assessing sustainability of the manufacture of basic chemicals from renewable biomass are discussed. The development of a sustainable biobased production of chemicals meshes well with the concept of a circular economy, based on resource efficiency and waste minimization by design, to replace traditional linear, take-make-use-dispose economies.},

The resulting stream was worked-up inline using liquid-liquid extraction with membrane-based separators that were scaled-up from microfluidic designs.

	abstract     = {Continuous processing, as a form of process intensification, is one of the keys of green engineering research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. It has the potential to reduce solvent use and cost of production as well as increase production quality and operational safety. In light of the increased research interest surrounding continuous processing, the goal of this work is to compare the environmental performances of batch (BP) and continuous (CP) processing of 4-d-erythronolactone (4-DEL) at pilot plant scale as case study. The processing systems are evaluated using green chemistry metrics and a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA). The processing serves as the case study for this article's goal. The LCA system boundary includes raw material extraction, transportation, synthesis of 4-DEL (as part of primary pharmaceutical manufacturing), equipment cleaning, plant utilities, and off-site waste management. In order to obtain life cycle inventories to support the LCA study of the BP and CP systems, a modular approach is taken to address their differences. As part of a modular approach, theoretical production campaigns are constructed for the production scale of 49.6 kg of 4-DEL within 5 days; the campaigns account for the time-bounded activities which affects the overall rate of production. The analysis shows that, under the assumptions used, using continuous processing for 4-DEL production has a lower environmental burden compared to batch mainly due to less equipment cleaning and a smaller plant footprint. This is reflected in a 30.1{\%} lower cumulative mass intensity and reductions of various life cycle impacts such as global warming potential (-57.5{\%}), human toxicity (-9.37{\%}), and water depletion index (-41.7{\%}). Sensitivity analysis on equipment cleaning and the consideration of various end-of-life waste treatment options illustrates the need to include them in the system boundary for a fair comparison between batch and continuous.},

	abstract     = {Driven by the economics of scale, the size of reaction vessels as the major processing apparatus of the chemical industry has became bigger and bigger [1, 2]. Consequently, the efforts for ensuring mixing and heat transfer have also increased, as these are scale dependent. This has brought vessel operation to (partly severe) technical limits, especially when controlling harsh conditions, e.g., due to large He at releases. Accordingly, processing at a very large scale has resulted in taming of the chemistry involved in order to slow it down to a technically controllable level. Therefore, reaction paths that already turned out too aggressive at the laboratory scale are automatically excluded for later scale-up, which constitutes a common everyday confinement in exploiting chemical transformations. Organic chemists are barely conscious that even the small-scale laboratory protocols in their textbooks contain many slow, disciplined chemical reactions. Operations such as adding a reactant drop by drop in a large diluted solvent volume have become second nature, but are not intrinsic to the good engineering of chemical reactions. These are intrinsic to the chemical apparatus used in the past. In contrast, today's process intensification [3-12] and the new flow-chemistry reactors on the micro- and milli-scale [13-39] allow such limitations to be overcome, and thus, enable a complete, ab-initio type rethinking of the processes themselves. In this way, space-time yields and the productivity of the reactor can be increased by orders of magnitude and other dramatic performance step changes can be achieved. A hand-in-hand design of the reactors and process re-thinking is required to enable chemistry rather than subduing chemistry around the reactor [40]. This often leads to making use of process conditions far from conventional practice, under harsh environments, a procedure named here as Novel Process Windows. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

This paper considers the preliminary study of the robustness analysis of this pilot-scale distillation column. Using a combination of plant data and non-linear simulations, both a nominal column model and an associated model uncertainty are identified. This information is used to carry out a complete analysis of robust stability and performance for the case where a (Ziegler-Nichols tuned) multiloop control scheme is employed. To perform robustness analysis of the control, both structured and highly structured uncertainty characterization approaches are used and it is shown that the latter case provides less conservative results. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It will also be shown that set-point weighting is superior to the conventional solution of reducing large overshoot by gain detuning or set-point filtering. However, for excessive set-point undershoot, the tuning formula will have to be modified. For PI autotuning, it will be shown that the Ziegler-Nichols tuning formula is inadequate and has to be completely revised. The application of set-point weighting and the modification of the tuning formula can be based simply on the knowledge of the normalised gain or normalised deadtime of the process.

This method is applied to a MIMO non-square coupled distillation column (3 inputs and 2 outputs) system. Both centralized and decentralized controllers are designed by using the genetic algorithm optimization method. The proposed centralized controller tuned by the genetic algorithm gives the best performance when compared to the decentralized controller and other analytical methods. These proposed ranges of controller parameters for genetic algorithm can make the convergence faster than the method proposed for multivariable square systems by Vlachos et al.},

A standard least-squares optimization method is used to obtain the parameters of the FOPTD models by matching the closed-loop step responses of the model with those of the actual process. A simple method is proposed to obtain the initial guess values for the transfer function model parameters from the process main and interaction responses. The effects of measurement noise and controller settings on the identified model parameters were also studied. This method was applied to stable FOPTD and higher-order transfer function models of multivariable systems. The proposed method considerably reduces the computational time (by about a factor of 15) for the optimization when compared with the genetic algorithm method reported by Viswanathan et al. (Ind.

The need of simple, robust and general method, which can overcome deficiencies of EOSs, especially in critical regions, is obvious. In this study, a mathematical algorithm based on Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) has been developed for simulating 425 VLE data of seven CO2/hydrocarbon binary mixtures in supercritical or near critical conditions. The target value, bubble point/dew point pressure, is considered as a function of reduced temperature, hydrocarbon mole fraction and the hydrocarbons acentric factor and critical pressure. The proposed LSSVM model with its magnificent R2 of 0.9932 and AARD{\%} of 3.61 is proving able to predict VLE data of CO2/hydrocarbon binary mixture in a very precise manner. In addition, comparison of LSSVM with EOSs indicates its supremacy over conventional methods. A sensitivity analysis, with three different methods, was performed on the independent variables in an effort to determine the relative importance of each one. At the end with the aid of Leverage statistical algorithm, the statistical validity of the model was guaranteed and proved that the majority of the data points are in the applicability domain of the proposed LSSVM.},

However, for non-aqueous solutions, few machine learning studies have been undertaken so far despite the fact that the solvation mechanism plays an important role in various chemical reactions. Here, we introduce Delfos (deep learning model for solvation free energies in generic organic solvents), which is a novel, machine-learning-based QSPR method which predicts solvation free energies for various organic solute and solvent systems. A novelty of Delfos involves two separate solvent and solute encoder networks that can quantify structural features of given compounds via word embedding and recurrent layers, augmented with the attention mechanism which extracts important substructures from outputs of recurrent neural networks. As a result, the predictor network calculates the solvation free energy of a given solvent-solute pair using features from encoders. With the results obtained from extensive calculations using 2495 solute-solvent pairs, we demonstrate that Delfos not only has great potential in showing accuracy comparable to that of the state-of-the-art computational chemistry methods, but also offers information about which substructures play a dominant role in the solvation process.},

The experimental setup consists of commercially available modules assembled such that the setup automatically prepares the sample mixtures, waits for equilibrium, takes samples, and analyses them. Gas chromatography (GC) is employed to maximise flexibility with respect to the mixtures that can be studied. For GC analysis, neither further dilution nor addition of an external standard is needed. In step 2, the gathered data are converted into concentration data and the gE-models UNIQUAC and NRTL are adjusted to the data.

Herein we report the implementation of a new multi-objective machine learning optimization algorithm for self-optimization, and demonstrate it in two exemplar chemical reactions performed in continuous flow. The algorithm successfully identified a set of optimal conditions corresponding to the trade-off curve (Pareto front) between environmental and economic objectives in both cases. Thus, it reveals the complete underlying trade-off and is not limited to one compromise as is the case in many other studies. The machine learning algorithm proved to be extremely data efficient, identifying the optimal conditions for the objectives in a lower number of experiments compared to single-objective optimizations. The complete underlying trade-off between multiple objectives is identified without arbitrary weighting factors, but via true multi-objective optimization.},

Two consecutive reactions are performed in different solvents, with catalyst separation and inter-reaction solvent exchange achieved by continuous flow membrane units. A Heck coupling reaction is performed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a continuous membrane reactor which retains the catalyst. The Heck reaction product undergoes solvent exchange in a counter-current membrane system where DMF is continuously replaced by ethanol. After exchange the product dissolved in ethanol passes through a column packed with an iron catalyst, and undergoes reduction ({\textgreater}99 {\%} yield).},

The PID gains are set by the Z-N method, and are then adapted online through the fuzzy Q-Learning agent. The fuzzy Q-Learning agent is used instead of the conventional Q-Learning, in order to deal with the continuous state-action space. The fuzzy Q-Learning agent defines its state according to the value of the error. The output signal of the agent consists of three output variables, in which each one defines the percentage change of each gain. Each gain can be increased or decreased from 0{\%} to 50{\%} of its initial value. Through this method, the gains of the controller are adjusted online via the interaction of the environment. The knowledge of the expert is not a necessity during the setup process. The simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed control strategy. After the exploration phase, the settling time is reduced in the steady states. In the transient states, the response has less amplitude oscillations and reaches the equilibrium point faster than the conventional PID controller.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A recent estimate of R{\&}D spending is {\$}2.7 billion (2017 US dollars). However, this analysis lacks transparency and independent replication. OBJECTIVE: To provide a contemporary estimate of R{\&}D spending to develop cancer drugs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of US Securities and Exchange Commission filings for drug companies with no drugs on the US market that received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for a cancer drug from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015. Cumulative R{\&}D spending was estimated from initiation of drug development activity to date of approval. Earnings were also identified from the time of approval to the present. The study was conducted from December 10, 2016, to March 2, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Median R{\&}D spending on cancer drug development. RESULTS: Ten companies and drugs were included in this analysis. The 10 companies had a median time to develop a drug of 7.3 years (range, 5.8-15.2 years). Five drugs (50{\%}) received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, and 5 (50{\%}) received regular approval. The median cost of drug development was {\$}648.0 million (range, {\$}157.3 million to {\$}1950.8 million). The median cost was {\$}757.4 million (range, {\$}203.6 million to {\$}2601.7 million) for a 7{\%} per annum cost of capital (or opportunity costs) and {\$}793.6 million (range, {\$}219.1 million to {\$}2827.1 million) for a 9{\%} opportunity costs. With a median of 4.0 years (range, 0.8-8.8 years) since approval, the total revenue from sales of these 10 drugs since approval was {\$}67.0 billion compared with total R{\&}D spending of {\$}7.2 billion ({\$}9.1 billion, including 7{\%} opportunity costs). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The cost to develop a cancer drug is {\$}648.0 million, a figure significantly lower than prior estimates. The revenue since approval is substantial (median, {\$}1658.4 million; range, {\$}204.1 million to {\$}22 275.0 million). This analysis provides a transparent estimate of R{\&}D spending on cancer drugs and has implications for the current debate on drug pricing.},

To address these challenging demands, integrated continuous processing, comprised of high-density perfusion cell culture and a directly coupled continuous capture step, can be used as a universal biomanufacturing platform. This study reports the first successful demonstration of the integration of a perfusion bioreactor and a four-column periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) system for the continuous capture of candidate protein therapeutics. Two examples are presented: (1) a monoclonal antibody (model of a stable protein) and (2) a recombinant human enzyme (model of a highly complex, less stable protein). In both cases, high-density perfusion CHO cell cultures were operated at a quasi-steady state of 50-60×106cells/mL for more than 60 days, achieving volumetric productivities much higher than current perfusion or fed-batch processes. The directly integrated and automated PCC system ran uninterrupted for 30 days without indications of time-based performance decline. The product quality observed for the continuous capture process was comparable to that for a batch-column operation. Furthermore, the integration of perfusion cell culture and PCC led to a dramatic decrease in the equipment footprint and elimination of several non-value-added unit operations, such as clarification and intermediate hold steps. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrated continuous bioprocessing as a universal platform for the manufacture of various kinds of therapeutic proteins. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This paper reviews the currently known IO selection methods, which aids the control engineer in picking a suitable method for the problem at hand. The methods are grouped according to the control system property that is addressed and applications are grouped according to the considered control systems. A set of criteria is proposed that a good IO selection method should possess. It is used to assess and compare the methods and it could be used as a guideline for new methods.

	abstract     = {This paper describes the design of an advanced control algorithm for the cooling system of a large business and commercial centre. This complex system comprises phenomena that are difficult to model with physical principles, such as the demand of the users, heat transport phenomena in a large and complex pipe network, and the behaviour of cooling elements installed by third parties. Motivated by these features, a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed in this paper. The data-driven procedure requires only high-level prior information, making it easy to implement and to replicate on similar systems. Specifically, to derive a dynamic model of the plant, a comparison among AutoRegeressive eXogenous (ARX), Output Error (OE), Echo State Networks (ESN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks has been performed. The latter have been eventually selected in view of their higher predictive performance on a validation dataset. Then, an output feedback MPC scheme has been designed to cope with the nonlinearity of the model and the presence of boolean control inputs, corresponding to the on/off switching of the cooling units. The resulting MPC algorithm has been tested on a grey-box model of the system, showing significant potential improvements with respect to the baseline controller currently employed.},

Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial data sets spanning a wide variety of chemical end points. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary data sets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.},

However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},

Recently, a machine learning method, graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown promising results for the prediction of structure-property relationships. GNNs utilize a graph representation of molecules, where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds to edges containing information about the molecular structure. More specifically, GNNs learn physico-chemical properties as a function of the molecular graph in a supervised learning setup using a backpropagation algorithm. This end-to-end learning approach eliminates the need for selection of molecular descriptors or structural groups, as it learns optimal fingerprints through graph convolutions and maps the fingerprints to the physico-chemical properties by deep learning. We develop GNN models for predicting three fuel ignition quality indicators, i.e., the derived cetane number (DCN), the research octane number (RON), and the motor octane number (MON), of oxygenated and non-oxygenated hydrocarbons. In light of limited experimental data in the order of hundreds, we propose a combination of multi-task learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning. The results show competitive performance of the proposed GNN approach compared to state-of-the-art QSPR models making it a promising field for future research.

Methods capable of predicting melting points (MP) solely from chemical structure represent a canonical example, and are highly desirable in many crucial industrial applications. In this work, we explore a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and understand the MP of molecules. Several experimental databases are aggregated from the literature to design a low-bias dataset that includes 3D structural and quantum-chemical properties. Using experimental and polymorph-induced uncertainties, we derive a tenable lower limit for MP prediction accuracy, and apply graph neural networks and Gaussian processes to predict MP competitive with these error bounds. To further understand how MP correlates with molecular structure, we employ several semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques. First, we use unsu-pervised clustering methods to identify classes of molecules, their common fragments, and expected errors for each data set. We then build molecular geometric spaces shaped by MP with a semi-supervised variational autoencoder and graph embedding spaces, and apply graph attribution methods to highlight atom-level contributions to MP within the datasets. Overall, this work serves as a case study of how to employ a diversified ML toolkit to predict and understand correlations between molecular structures and thermophysical properties of interest.},

In this report, we propose a probabilistic matrix factorization model for predicting the activity coefficients in arbitrary binary mixtures.

In transfer learning, prediction models trained under a set of available data from a target domain (e.g., house with limited data) can be improved through the use of data generated from similar source domains (e.g., houses with rich data). Given also the need for prediction models that can be trained online (e.g., as part of a model-predictive-control implementation), this paper introduces the generalized online transfer learning algorithm (GOTL). It employs a weighted combination of the available predictors (i.e., the target and source predictors) and guarantees convergence to the best weighted predictor. Furthermore, the use of Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) allows for using more than a single source domains, since it may facilitate the fit of a single model on more than one source domains (houses). This allows GOTL to transfer knowledge from more than one source domains. We further validate our results through experiments in climate control for residential buildings and show that GOTL may lead to non-negligible energy savings for given comfort levels.},

	abstract     = {For separation of a two-component mixture, a three-stage organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) process is presented which comprises of a two-stage membrane cascade for separation with a third membrane stage added for integrated solvent recovery, i.e. solvent recycling. The two-stage cascade allows for increased separation selectivity whilst the integrated solvent recovery stage mitigates the otherwise large solvent consumption of the purification. This work explores the effect of washing the solvent recovery unit at intervals in order to attain high product purities with imperfect solvent recovery membranes possessing less than 100{\%} rejection of the impurity. This operation attains a purity of 98.7{\%} through semi-continuous operation with two washes of the solvent recovery stage, even when imperfect membranes are used in a closed-loop set-up. This contrasts favourably with the 83.0{\%} maximum purity achievable in a similar set-up with a single continuous run. The process achieves slightly lower (-0.7{\%}) yield of around 98.2{\%} compared to a continuously operated process without solvent recovery but consumes approx. 85{\%} less solvent (theoretical analysis suggests up to 96{\%} reduction is possible). 9 different membranes, both commercial (GMT, Novamem, SolSep) and in-house fabricated, are screened and tested on a separation challenge associated with the synthesis of macrocycles - amongst the membrane materials are polyimide (PI), polybenzimidazole (PBI) and, polyetheretherketone (PEEK).},
