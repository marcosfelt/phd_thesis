\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
When I arrived in Cambridge for a MPhil Research, I had no idea that I would be finishing a PhD nearly five years later. I am grateful to Prof. Alexei Lapkin who saw in me something that I didn't see at the time; that a PhD was the right and best way to achieve my goals! Prof. Lapkin has been a supportive and patient supervisor. I thank him for allowing me to explore my wide range of interests. He gracefully dealt with my simultaneously great ambitions and tendency to leave things to the last minute. He was the perfect supervisor for me.

I would like to thank my collaborators at BASF, Carsten Kn\"osche and Julian Meyer-Kirschner, for their patience and commitment to achieving our goals. I also admire Christian Holtze for always focusing on how to translate the insights from my research to applications at BASF and greatly appreciate Prof. Alexander Mitsos and Prof. Kai Leonhard for facilitating my virtual stay at RWTH Aachen.

I would like to thank the student and postdoc collaborators who helped make this work possible. I first worked with Jan Rittig on Summit when he was an intern our group in the summer of 2020 and subsequently in the last year of my PhD on ML-SAFT. His constant stream of great ideas, knowledge of the literature and ability to rapidly implement anything in code always amazes me. Daniel Wigh was an excellent collaborator and friend; he was the only person crazy enough to yes to my idea to code and write a conference paper in three days. I am forever grateful for his openness to new ideas and curiosity. Connor Taylor was an outstanding experimental collaborator who showed me how to be an efficient researcher and always made me laugh. Lukas Ra{\ss}pe-Lange's insights into thermodynamics were invaluable for our paper on ML-SAFT, and Hashem Ben-Safar bravely learned to code for the work on \textit{DeepGamma}. I am also grateful to Alexander Pomberger and Daniel Wigh for collaborating on a transfer learning project for reaction optimization, even if the outcome was different than what we would have expected.

The Sustainable Reaction Engineering Group and SynTech CDT were essential to my PhD journey. I would like to give special thanks to Adarsh Arun for taking on all the initiatives that I started but could not continue, Ahmad Khan for our stimulating conversations, and Perman Jorayev for always making me laugh. To Mehrnaz and Chung, the coordinators of the SynTech CDT coordinator, thank you for making the experience of my the first years smooth.

I am grateful to the the people who helped me solve computational bottlenecks in my work. Jana Marie Weber showed me how to use the Cambridge cluster during my MPhil research, which was essential to scaling the experiments in the work on Summit. Robert Lee from Lightning.ai helped me debug the software that was used to scale the experiments for the multi-task Bayesian optimization and ML-SAFT papers. 

In the second year of my PhD, I embarked on a journey of entrepreneurship  via ConceptionX. Thank you to  Chandler Gonzales taking the plunge with me and being also open to shutting it down.  I am grateful to the staff at ConceptionX, Nick Russel and Patrick Gilday for providing mentorship.  

Thank you to my friends for their support. Andrew Kristof was always a call away, and we shared many struggles of PhD life together! I am also thankful to my church family, especially Horton and Amanda, who were like grandparents to me. My housemates over the years made Cambridge feel like home during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. I would particularly like to thank my final year housemates Sofia and Chie who changed my perspective on how all parts of your life can be consistent. 

My grandmothers, who both passed away during my PhD, were always my loudest cheerleaders, and I am forever grateful for their love and support. I most of all want to thank my parents who gave me immense opportunities and taught me to work hard and ask good questions. Thank you mom and dad for always reminding me to focus on what is most important. I would not have completed this degree without your loving support!

Finally, thank you Ernie for always putting a smile on my face and helping me to get through the hardest times and celebrate the best ones.
