\chapter*{Abstract}

One of the greatest challenges in process development is the limited amount of data that can be collected. Techniques that can enhance the insights which can be drawn this limited data have the possiblity to accelerate process development. This thesis presents a collection of studies on using transfer learning to accelerate various aspects of process development. The first part focuses on reaction optimization, where I propose a benchmarking framework for comparing machine learning models and demonstrate the benefits of using multi-task learning to accelerate chemical reaction optimization. In the second part,I explore the use of reinforcement learning and multifidelity Bayesian optimization for accelerating feedback controller tuning, specifically for distillation control systems. Finally, in the third part, I take two perspectives on using machine learning for predictive thermodynamics, a key aspect of process modeling. I introduce \textit{DeepGamma}, DeepGamma and ML-SAFT, for predicting activity coefficients and PCP-SAFT parameters. These studies demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to accelerate process development, providing valuable insights for future research and practical applications.
